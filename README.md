proctor-sample-matrix
=====================

This is a sample set of [Proctor](https://github.com/indeedeng/proctor) test definition files and a Maven pom.xml that demonstrates how to use the Maven plugin's generator to build them into a single JSON test matrix file.

There are three sample test definitions in [src/main/proctor-data/test-definitions/](https://github.com/indeedeng/proctor-sample-matrix/tree/master/src/main/proctor-data/test-definitions).

Simply clone this project and run "mvn" to generate the JSON file (target/proctor-test-matrix.json).
